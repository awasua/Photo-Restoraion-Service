# Photo-Restoraion-Service
Phototype GPF-GAN is a deep learning model for photo restoration that aims to remove damaged parts from old photos and replace them with newly generated parts using Stable Diffusion. This repository provides the code and pre-trained model for the Phototype GPF-GAN, along with instructions for usage and training.

# Introduction
Photo restoration is a challenging task that involves repairing and enhancing old photos that have been damaged due to aging, wear and tear, or other factors. Traditional methods for photo restoration often require manual intervention and can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the advent of deep learning techniques, GAN-based models have shown promising results in automating the photo restoration process.

The Phototype GPF-GAN model is based on the Generative Progressive Fusion GAN architecture, which is designed to effectively remove damaged parts from old photos and generate realistic replacement parts. The model is trained using Stable Diffusion, a diffusion-based regularization technique that helps to improve the stability and quality of the generated images.

# Features
* Photo restoration using GAN-based model
* Stable Diffusion for regularization
* Automatic removal of damaged parts
* Realistic generation of replacement parts
* Easy-to-use code and pre-trained model
# Usage
1 Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/awasua/photo-restoration-service.git
2 Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the documentation.
3 Download the pre-trained model weights from here and place them in the weights folder.
4 Run the restoration script restoration.py with the input image path and desired output path as arguments.
#bash
''' python restoration.py --input_path /path/to/input_image.jpg --output_path /path/to/output_image.jpg
Optionally, you can also train the model from scratch using your own dataset by following the instructions provided in the documentation.
Training
To train the Phototype GPF-GAN model on your own dataset, you can follow the steps below:

# Prepare your dataset of damaged and corresponding original photos.
Preprocess the images, such as resizing, cropping, and normalization, as per your requirements.
Use the provided training script train.py to train the model with your dataset. You can customize the hyperparameters and training settings as needed.
bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_dir /path/to/dataset --epochs 100 --batch_size 16 --lr 0.0002
The trained model weights will be saved in the weights folder, which you can use for restoration or further fine-tuning.
